# Credits

This is a Thesaurus for Spanish words. As there are not many (I couldn't find any) open APIs for thesaurus in Spanish, I used https://www.sinonimosonline.com/.

This workflow is based on Alfy https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy.

"Couldn't find the 'node' binary. Symlink it to '/usr/local/bin'", please go ahead and [download npm from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
